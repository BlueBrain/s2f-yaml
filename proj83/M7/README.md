Contains a s2f.yaml file, configuring a run of s2f-recipe.

This file is meant to be used for the circuit at:
/gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj82/scratch/circuits/

It configures one s2f-recipe run for each region of the right hemisphere. The resulting parameters will then be applied to all connections _originating_ from the region.
